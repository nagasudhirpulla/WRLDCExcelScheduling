Pseudo Code for desired Requisition creation from excel
-------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisite - Fetch the max revision number from revision table and load the combo box for revision selection by the user

Prerequisite - Load the generator names combo box

Setup the database connection

Get the generator sname from the combo box

Get the date from the date input text box

Get the revision number from the revision number input box

Get the generator id for the selected generator sname from the generator table

Get the constituent snames and ids of the constituents who have entitlements in the generator with appropriate enforcement date from the entitlements table

Clear the desired entitlements sheet and desired requisitions page

Paste the snames from A2 in horizontal direction

Get the appropriate entitlements for all the snames and paste them in the desired entitlements page. This acts as a cache for the entitlement check and data validation purposes

Check the order of snames in the desired page and abort with warning and console entry if order not satisfied

Start the Transaction (#future)

Iterate through each constituent sname header
    Do the data validations like desired belongs to [0, entitlement] if numeric and if non numeric check if value is FULL, numeric+p (check for TMS pattern, OWN+RSD, OWN+URS+RSD PATTERN in the #future).
    
    If data validation fails, then color the cells red and skip the iteration for the row
  
    Get the value from each row and insert it in desired table if value not equal to above row value
    
End the Transaction (#future)

End the database connection
